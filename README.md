## Overview

This project aims to provide a unified platform for:

- **Hostel Management for Schools**: Creating, listing, and managing student accommodations, bed allotments, and occupant details.
- **Home, Hotel, Motel Booking**: Search, reserve, and pay for short-term or long-term stays.
- **Leasing Management**: Create and manage leasing contracts, rent collection, maintenance requests, etc.

We will build a responsive and scalable solution using **Next.js** and **TypeScript**, following best practices for a smooth developer experience.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourTeam/your-project.git
   cd your-project
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   # or
   bun install
3. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your environment variables. Refer to `.env.example` for the required variables.
4. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   # or
   bun dev
5. **Open the application**
   Visit: [http://localhost:3000]() to see the application running.
6. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
   # or
   pnpm build
   # or
   bun build

## Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your environment variables. Refer to `.env.example` for the required variables.
```ini
DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=public_api_key_for_frontend
```

## Scripts
- `dev`: Starts the development server.
- `build`: Builds the application for production.
- `start`: Starts the production server.
- `lint`: Runs ESLint to check for code quality issues.
- `test`: Runs Jest tests.
Example
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "eslint . --ext .js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx",
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
```


## Contributing Rules

1. **Write clear, concise commit messages.**  
   - e.g., `feat: add booking cancellation logic`, `fix: handle null properties in listing`.

2. **Ensure all lint checks pass before committing.**  
   - Use `npm run lint` or `yarn lint` to check.

3. **Keep pull requests focused and small.**  
   - Avoid combining multiple features/bugfixes into a single pull request.

4. **All new features must have corresponding tests** (unit or integration) where feasible.

5. **Document your code** with clear comments and in-code docstrings where necessary. 
```ts
 /**
 * Books a property for a specific user.
 *
 * @param propertyId - The unique ID of the property to be booked
 * @param userId - The ID of the user making the booking
 * @param bookingDetails - Object containing date range and payment info
 * @returns A boolean indicating whether the booking was successful
 */
function bookProperty(propertyId: string, userId: string, bookingDetails: BookingInfo): boolean {
  // booking logic
  return true;
}
```

## Feature Implementation Guidelines

When building or updating a module:

1. **Create or update the interface/TypeScript types** in `typings/` or within the module folder.
2. **Add or update service functions** in `services/` if needed (e.g., `booking-service.ts`).
3. **Use a consistent naming convention** for components and functions.  
   - e.g., a component with a capitalized and descriptive name: `Property-card.tsx`.
4. **Implement any new hooks** in `hooks/`.
5. **Write tests** in the corresponding folder in `tests/` (mirroring file structure if possible).

---

## Branching & Pull Request Guidelines

### Branch Naming

- **Feature branches**: `feat/<description>` (e.g., `feat/booking-flow`)  
- **Bugfix branches**: `fix/<description>` (e.g., `fix/booking-typo`)  
- **Hotfix branches**: `hotfix/<critical-issue>`

### Pull Requests

1. **Describe changes, motivations, and relevant issue references.**  
2. **Include instructions for testing manually** if needed.  
3. **Assign at least one reviewer** and wait for approval before merging.

---

## Linting & Code Formatting

This project uses **ESLint** and **Prettier** for a consistent code style.

- **ESLint** checks for potential errors, best practices, etc.  
  - Configuration in `.eslintrc.js`.
- **Prettier** handles code formatting.  
  - Configuration in `.prettierrc`.

**Recommended workflow**:

1. Install [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) plugins in your IDE.
2. Auto-format on save to keep code consistent.

**Notes**: this apps comes everything installed and ready to go.

---

## Testing

Testing is done using **Jest** and/or **React Testing Library** (your choice). Some guidelines:

1. **Unit Tests** live under `tests/<moduleName>/` or alongside components.
2. **Integration Tests** ensure complex flows work (like booking + payment).
3. **Naming Convention**: `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts` for test files.
4. **Script**: `npm test` or `yarn test`.
5. **Coverage**: Aim to maintain a healthy coverage (decide on a target as a team).
